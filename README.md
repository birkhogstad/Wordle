## Wordle

As I have played the game 'Wordle' the last week, I saw the opportunity to recreate the game as a way of refreshing my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript!

I have chosen to use 'vanilla' HTML and Javascript, as I don't really have time to put too much effort into this project. My main thought is to practice and enjoy programming!:)


### Solution

I decided to remove the letters that has been tested, but does not fit for the solution. I thought this was how the proper game worked, but I have later realized that that is not the case.. This is something I might change later.

As of doing the project, I went with "ROBOT" as the solution. I am planning on implementing a list of valid words, which I then will take out a random word to use as the solution. Each attemps the used enters also has to fit this list. My next step would be to find a proper list to use, but the lists I have made/found contains names, which I am not interested in.
